## HOW THE F*CK DOES A GPS RECEIVER WORK?

Modulate a 1575.42GHz sine carrier with a spreading sequence, then a data stream.
Calculate a pseudorange according to both.
```python
#| code-fold: true
import numpy as np
import numpy.typing as npt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Generating our Gold Code Sequences

We won't be generating our own gold code sequences.
```python
# Look up table for PRNs 1-32


```

#### How do they correlate?

#### Sub sample correlation.
